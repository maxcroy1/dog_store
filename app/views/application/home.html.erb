        <p> Malcolm and Alex created Bruno's Treats in 2020 and is inspired by 
        their dog Bruno's love for treats.  We are a Brooklyn based business
        that sells dog treats, toys and care products.  Our mission is to make healthy
        treats, that we know your dog will love.  Our treats are homemade
        using high quality locally sourced ingredients. We sell our products on 
        our online store and at local New York farmers market's.
